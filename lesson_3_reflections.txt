1)When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
A:When I am working from a different computer or someone else is also working for the current application

2)Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
A:To take control of the situation

3)Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.
When would you use one instead of another?
A:forks: type of clone from github to github
clones: from server to local computer
branches: create parallel versions of application

4)What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the 
remote stored locally?
A:we can work on the local known state so that we can work offline and then
merge the directory after getting online

5)How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? 
What would be easier, and what would be harder?
A:With using git by making the other person the collaborator
it would be much easier to do so.

6)When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? 
What benefits does each approach have?
A:When we want to add a feature to the app without collapsing the master branch
and also when other's are trying to incorporate certain features so that after 
making the necessary changes pull requests can be raised and then with the help
of github we can see the changes and can plan to merge.
